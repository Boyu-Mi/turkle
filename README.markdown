Run a clone of Amazon's Mechanical **Turk** service in your **l**ocal
**e**nvironment.

This tool is meant to be used as a web service running locally on your network
or personal machine. It will load HIT template files generated by the Amazon
Mechanical Turk web GUI provided to requesters for creating HITs. TSV files are
also required to be uploaded as well in order to create a HIT based on the
template from each row of values in the TSV file.
